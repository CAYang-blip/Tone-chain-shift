Thai 2023ː data extracted from Figure 1.1 Bottomː "Thai tones produced in isolation from Burroni et al. (2021), data are averaged across 5 adult speakers. Note that, for the bottom panel, the segmental material is not constant, but f0 is tracked over rimes. Note also that tones are time-normalized within each category."
